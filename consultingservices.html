                    <p><b>Autonomous things are things that work autonomously without direct intervention or human guidance.<br>
            Autonomous things exploit AI (Artificial Intelligence) to deliver various advanced behaviours that can interact <br>
            more naturally with all of their surroundings. Autonomous things are being used in many different ways, <br>
            the most popular being the self-driving car, robots and drones. We also use autonomous technology in our everyday<br>
            lives such as taking money out of the bank.</b></p>

            <h4> Immersive Experience</h4>
            <p><b>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that will completely surround you in a way that makes you feel <br> 
                that you are inside it and part of it.
                There are two types of immersive experiences,<br>
                one is when youâ€™re actually in a physical environment and the other is where you are shown around <br>
                an imagined or a real environment via a tablet, Virtual Reality (VR) or a mobile.</b></p>
