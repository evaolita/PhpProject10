<p>As of the 5th of March, Hockey Ireland accepted the resignation of their senior women’s head coach <br>
    Graham Shaw as he takes up a new position of head coach of New Zealand’s senior international women. 
    Shaw has been both an international player and part of the coaching set up since 2010. During Shaw’s tenure 
    the ‘Green Army’ have gone from 16th to 8th in the world and qualified for their first World Cup since 2002. 
    In the 2018 World Cup Shaw led them to a silver medal and a first ever World Cup final for any Irish team sport. <br>
The FIH have recently announced the groups for the Green Machine's Hockey Series Finals in Le Touquet, France this June. 
Ireland will sit in Pool A with Egypt, Scotland and Singapore.</p>
