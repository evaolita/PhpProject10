<p>This past summer I went interrailing for 15 days. <br>
    The countries I travelled to included Amsterdam, Berlin, Prague, Budapest and Croatia. 
    In each country we tried to visit as many tourist destinations as possible, for example the Berlin wall,<br>
    the old town in Prague and Anne Franksâ€™ house in Amsterdam. We got to experience all different cultures
    lifestyles and fashion in such a short period of time. As the name suggests we travelled by train to each new destination.
    This proved to be more challenging then expected due to different
    currencies and languages but it just made me appreciate different countries even more.</p>
